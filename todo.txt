Things that are a must:
- Pagination of network calls
- Caching / DB first approach ( routes are presumably quite static )
- Departure time tick down
- Departure time automatic re-fetch
- More test coverage, including UI tests
- Some actual theming
- Watch oriented UI
- App icon

Things should probably be done:
- Clock-face Widget
- Sorting of routes ( does the api support it? )
- Route search
- Route alerts / notices
- Show other routes for a stop

Things that would be cool:
- Alternative layouts for round / square display
- More animations
- Support other transport methods
- Set timer / alert for a given departure time
- User selectable themes
- Set up CI for repo
